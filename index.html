						<h2>Ultimate Frisbee Festival</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Our primary goal with Bid For Peace is to put on a party that everyone will enjoy and at the same time, raise a bunch of money to give to Ultimate Peace. Here's an idea of what we've done in the past to accomplish this goal.</p>

							<h3>Showcase Games</h3>
							<p>There are some incredible ultimate players in Minnesota and we like to showcase their skills in matchups that you won't see anywhere else. Whether it's pro vs. club, or an elite women's team against the ladies from the top mixed teams, the games are always exciting.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/band.png" alt="guitar shreds" /></span>
							<h3>Entertainment</h3>
							<p>We're not doing our jobs if you're not having an awesome time. We've hired bands, played spikeball and cornhole, and raffled everything from jerseys to burritos. It'll be an awesome day of fun and you'll probably go home with something.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Hat Tournament</h3>
							<p>We've found that hosting a hat tournament is not only crazy fun, but it is also in the spirit of Ultimate Peace, which is all about creating new bonds of friendship and respect. Come meet some new people and see what you have to learn from each other.</p>

                            <p>In ultimate, "to bid," means to lay out, to unreasonably sacrifice your body for your team and the game and ultimately something bigger than yourself. We bid because we can't get enough of that plastic, because we get a rush when we close our eyes and envision being muddy, on the ground - disc in hand.</p>
                            <p>"To bid," outside the ultimate world, means to put money down for something, put a stake in something you want enough to commit to it, something you believe in even.</p>
                            <p>When we ask you to donate to Bid for Peace, we are asking you to bid, keeping both of these definitions in mind. Bid and reach for something greater than yourself. Bid out of the love of all things ultimate. Bid because you believe and would bet money on the fact that our small but mighty sport has the power to change the world for the better - starting with the next generation in the Middle East.</p>
